1. importing images in react three ways - importing images one by one our desired module, use require keyword in src inside paranthesis (same as you do in import's url), and direct links to src(network linkss)
2. so react hook is a just a function which enables us to hook into react internals. With the help of hook devs can use react's state and other features in a functional component, it empowers devs to do functional programming.By writing custom hooks we can use the functionality in other components.
3. it will re render everytime after the  component renders
4. spa - single page applications is one which does not loads the whole page but only renderes the changed components of the page.it is full of components and the spa keeps track of what hass changed and updates the ui accordingly. client side rendering vs server side rendering.
5. In server side routing as  the path changes the page is fetched from the server and the whole page is re rendered wether the data is same or different the page is re rendered on everyy changed path. whereas in client side routing (happens in spa) in the initial render a server side routing is happened and all the components are imported in the client side and when the path is changed it just changes the matching component's path and replaces it in the page.
